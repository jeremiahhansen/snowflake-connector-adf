# Snowflake Connector for Azure Data Factory (ADF)
This connector is an Azure Function which allows Azure Data Factory (ADF) to connect to Snowflake in a flexible way. It provides SQL-based stored procedure functionality with dyamic parameters and return values. Used with ADF you can build complete end-to-end data warehouse solutions for Snowflake while following Microsoft and Azure best practices around portability and security.

To get started please follow the steps outlined in the [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites) and [Deployment](#deployment) sections below.

As of January 2021 ADF does now provide a native Snowflake connector. But it is still not possible to run an arbitrary SQL query (let alone call a stored procedure) against Snowflake. When that functionality is available much of this connector will be obsolete.

_**CAUTION**_: This connector is limited to a maximum runtime of 230 seconds for each script executed. This limitation is not a result of this specific function's code, but rather of any HTTP triggered Azure Function (which is ultimately due to the default idle timeout of Azure Load Balancer). See [Function app timeout duration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale#timeout) for more details. If you need to run a query against Snowflake that takes more than 230 seconds you need to consider a different option. Microsoft recommends following [the Durable Functions async pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview#async-http) to get around this limitation. Fortunately, [dg-hub](https://github.com/dg-hub) has forked this project and updated it to make use of the durable functions async pattern. Please check out the [snowflake-durable-connector-adf project](https://github.com/dg-hub/snowflake-durable-connector-adf) for the details.

## Connector Overview
### High Level Overview
At a really high level stored procedures provide the ability to pass parameters, run multiple SQL statments, and return values. I'll explain how it works below, but to begin with here is a high level overview of the connector:

![Connector Overview](/Docs/Screenshots/connector-overview.png?raw=true "Connector Overview")

And a more detailed sequence diagram to help explain the overall process:

![Connector Sequence Diagram](/Docs/Screenshots/connector-sequence-diagram.png?raw=true "Connector Sequence Diagram")

Now let's dig a bit deeper into how this works. The following is a sample SQL script which this connector treats like a stored procedure:

```sql
SELECT $FIRST_NAME AS FIRST_NAME, 'Doe' AS LAST_NAME, 1 AS AGE;

SELECT CONCAT($FIRST_NAME, 'Bar') AS OUTPUT_1, $AGE + 100 AS OUTPUT_2;
```

The connector expects all input to be supplied via the `POST` body. Here is a sample `POST` body to execute the script above:

```json
{
    "databaseName": "MyDatabase",
    "schemaName": "MySchema",
    "storedProcedureName": "MyStoredProcedure",
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "FIRST_NAME",
            "type": "VARCHAR",
            "value": "Foo"
        },
        {
            "name": "AGE",
            "type": "NUMBER",
            "value": "10"
        }
    ]
}
```

And in this case the connector would return the following JSON object:

```json
{
    "OUTPUT_1": "FooBar",
    "OUTPUT_2": "110"
}
```

### Parameters
The connector leverages [Snowflake SQL session variables](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/session-variables.html) to pass values to the stored procedure script code.

The connector expects all parameters to be supplied via the `parameters` JSON array in the `POST` body. Here is a snippet from `POST` body in the [High Level Overview](#high-level-overview) section above which contains the parameter values:

```json
{
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "FIRST_NAME",
            "type": "VARCHAR",
            "value": "Foo"
        },
        {
            "name": "AGE",
            "type": "NUMBER",
            "value": "10"
        }
    ]
}
```

Basically it's an array of objects, with each object representing one parameter. Each parameter JSON object needs to contain the following three attributes:

1. name
1. type
1. value

With the following values for `type` currently supported:

* VARCHAR
* NUMBER

The connector generates a single `SET` query based of the parameters provided and executes it before running any of the queries in the SQL script. In this case the following `SET` query is generated:

```sql
SET (FIRST_NAME,AGE) = ('Foo',10)
```

The SQL queries in the script then access the parameters as standard Snowflake session variables. Here is the second query from the [High Level Overview](#high-level-overview) above which uses each parameter/variable:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT($FIRST_NAME, 'Bar') AS OUTPUT_1, $AGE + 100 AS OUTPUT_2;
```

For more advanced scenarios you can also leverage the Snowflake `IDENTIFIER()` function to dynamically reference Snowflake objects like databases, schemas, tables, columns, stage names, etc. See [String Literals / Session Variables / Bind Variables as Identifiers](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/identifier-literal.html) for more details.

### Multiple Queries
Executing multiple SQL statements in a stored procedure is critical to support non-trival use cases. As of September 2019 the Snowflake API does not support running multiple SQL statements in a single API call. Because of that we need to manualy break up the script into each individual statement and run them sequentially. We also need to make sure that we run then in the same Snowflake session so that session scoped variables (the parameters) can be used across queries.

The connector uses the standard SQL semicolon to identify query boundaries. As such the semicolon is required after each query.

### Return Values
Returning values from a stored procedure is critical so that we can pass status and other elements (like row counts) to the caller. To enable return values the connector expects the final query in the script to return a result set with a single row with one or more columns. Here is the second query again from the [High Level Overview](#high-level-overview) above that does just that:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT($FIRST_NAME, 'Bar') AS OUTPUT_1, $AGE + 100 AS OUTPUT_2;
```

The columns in the result are pivoted so that each column and value pair becomes one return value. The query above then returns two values `OUTPUT_1` and `OUTPUT_2`. Here is the resulting JSON object which the connector returns:

```json
{
    "OUTPUT_1": "FooBar",
    "OUTPUT_2": "110"
}
```

*Note:* If more than one row is returned in the final result the connector will fail with the following error: "Property with the same name already exists on object."


### Script Storage
All "stored procedure" scripts executed by this connector are stored in an Azure Blob Storage account. The container name is configurable but defaults to `storedprocedures`. Within the container all files are organized according to the following convention (all case sensitive):

```
/<Database Name>
    /<Schema Name>
        /<Stored Procedure Name>.sql
```

The connector expects all three parameters to be supplied via the JSON `POST` body. Here is a snippet from `POST` body in the [High Level Overview](#high-level-overview) section above which contains the required parameter values:

```json
{
    "databaseName": "MyDatabase",
    "schemaName": "MySchema",
    "storedProcedureName": "MyStoredProcedure"
}
```

The connector builds a blob storage path based off of those values and reads in the corresponding script file. In this case the full path is `/MyDatabase/MySchema/MyStoredProcedure.sql`. You can find the sample [MyStoredProcedure.sql](/Docs/SampleStoredProcedures/MyDatabase/MySchema/MyStoredProcedure.sql) script in the `/Docs` folder of this repo.

## Integration with ADF
### ADF Overview
This project comes with a few sample ADF pipelines which demonstrates how to use this connector within ADF. The sample ADF resources are deployed during the [Deployment](#deployment) section below and are contained in the [SnowflakeConnectorAdfArmTemplate.json](/Docs/SnowflakeConnectorAdfArmTemplate.json) script in the `/Docs` folder of this repo. Here is a screenshot showing one of the sample pipelines:

![ADF Pipeline Overview](/Docs/Screenshots/adf-pipeline-overview.png?raw=true "ADF Pipeline Overview")

As shown in the screenshot above we use the native `Azure Function` Activity in ADF to interact with the Snowflake connector. The HTTP method is `POST` and the body contains the elements described above.

### ADF Expressions
[Expressions in ADF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/control-flow-expression-language-functions) are very powerful and allow us to make the parameters passed to the connector very flexible. The screenshot above shows how to make use of ADF pipeline parameters when calling the connector. Here is the body of the HTTP request from the first ADF activity:

```json
{
  "databaseName": "MyDatabase",
  "schemaName": "MySchema",
  "storedProcedureName": "MyStoredProcedure",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "FIRST_NAME",
      "type": "VARCHAR",
      "value": "@{pipeline().parameters.FIRST_NAME}"
    },
    {
      "name": "AGE",
      "type": "NUMBER",
      "value": "@{pipeline().parameters.AGE}"
    }
  ]
}
```

And in order to access return values from an ADF activity we make use of the `activity()` expression function. Here is the body of the HTTP request from the second ADF activity:

```json
{
  "databaseName": "MyDatabase",
  "schemaName": "MySchema",
  "storedProcedureName": "MyStoredProcedure",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "FIRST_NAME",
      "type": "VARCHAR",
      "value": "@{activity('StoredProcedure1').output.OUTPUT_1}"
    },
    {
      "name": "AGE",
      "type": "NUMBER",
      "value": "@{activity('StoredProcedure1').output.OUTPUT_2}"
    }
  ]
}
```

In order to debug/run the Azure Function locally you need to create a `local.settings.json` file and add the three environment variables expected by the function. Here is a template for the contents of the file (you'll need to replace all <> placeholders with real values for your environment):

```json
{
    "IsEncrypted": false,
    "Values": {
        "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
        "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",
        "storageAccountConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<Storage Account Name>;AccountKey=<Storage Account Key>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net",
        "storageAccountContainerName": "storedprocedures",
        "snowflakeConnectionString": "account=<Snowflake Account Name>;host=<Snowflake Fully Qualified Host Name>;user=ADF_DEMO_USER;password=<Snowflake User Password>"
    }
}
```

See the [Snowflake Connector for .NET](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net) page for important details around the Snowflake account name.
